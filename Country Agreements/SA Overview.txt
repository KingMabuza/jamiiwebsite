Economic Overview

Real GDP increased by 0.7 percent in 2019, compared to 0.8 percent in 2018, and is expected to rise to 1.1 percent in 2020 and 1.8 percent in 2021, 
despite internal and global uncertainties. Agriculture and mining contractions slowed growth in 2019. In 2018, agriculture shrank by 4.8 percent, 
while mining shrank by 1.7 percent. Aside from the unpredictability of the weather, agriculture was hampered by a protracted discussion over land reform.
The demise of mining was exacerbated by electricity shortages and long-term strikes. In 2018, the finance, real estate, and business services sector rose 
by 1.8 percent, contributing 0.4 percentage point to overall growth. In 2018, transportation rose by 1.6 percent, while manufacturing grew by 1%.
Frequent power outages, rising input prices, and lackluster demand hampered manufacturing output amid continued international trade concerns. 

Consumption by households and governments remained a key driver of growth in 2018, adding 1.5 percentage points to growth. 
Due to decreasing fuel costs, inflation was 4.7 percent in 2018 and 4.4 percent in 2019.
The actual exchange rate grew by 8.1 percent from November 2017 to November 2018, reducing the competitiveness of South African exports. 
In 2018, the rand was valued at 13.23 cents per dollar. Exchange rate pass-through to inflation has been reduced as a result of inflation targeting.

The fiscal deficit is expected to remain high in 2019, at 4.3 percent, up from 4.2 percent in 2018, 
as the country continues to experience income shortfalls due to poor economic development. 
The tax revenue-to-GDP ratio fell slightly from 25.9% in 2018 to 25.7 percent in 2019. Domestic capital markets are used to fund the fiscal deficit.
In 2019, the federal government's debt was anticipated to be 55.6 percent of GDP, up from 52.7 percent in 2018. Only 6.3 percent of GDP was devoted to foreign debt, 
assuring long-term debt financing. In 2018, the current account deficit worsened to 3.5 percent as the terms of trade deteriorated, 
with import costs rising faster than export prices.
The current account deficit was mostly funded by foreign direct investment inflows, which increased 163 percent in 2018 over 2017. 

At the end of 2018, unemployment has risen to 27.1 percent, up from 26.5 percent at the end of 2016. At the end of 2018, 
youth unemployment has risen to 54.7 percent, up from 51 percent at the end of 2016. Low skills are one of the causes of high unemployment.
South Africa has one of the worst poverty rates in the world, at 55.5 percent, and one of the greatest levels of inequality. 
Economic growth and job creation are being hampered by structural impediments, which are being addressed through reforms. 
One is restructuring Eskom, a utility business, to lessen the significant risk that its debt poses to the Treasury.
Allocating telecoms spectrum, reducing impediments to mining investment, and revisiting visa rules to increase tourism are among the other reforms. 
The government is working to boost investment and revitalize townships and industrial parks. 

South Africa's global competitiveness ranking dropped dramatically from 47 in 2016 to 67 out of 140 nations in 2018.
Skill shortages, health-care issues, weak domestic product competition, and low use of information and communication technologies
were all factors in the decline. Because South Africa exports the majority of its mineral resources in raw form, value chain links between mining and 
manufacturing are poor. As a result, the country is exposed to recurring global commodity price shocks.

The South African economy is also threatened by weak global growth, global trade conflicts, and commodity price volatility. 
The budget is under strain due to a high public sector pay bill, poor performance of state-owned firms, and social programs such as national health insurance. 
More manufacturing for African markets would help South Africa.
